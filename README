--~~ Less for Rails ~~--

A plug-and-play hook for the fabulous Less CSS syntax, http://lesscss.org/.






              -- Usage --
       
      1. Install the gem, `gem install less`       
      2. Install the plugin, 
        `script/plugin install git://github.com/augustl/less-for-rails.git`
      3. Create public/stylesheets/yourfile.less
      4. Use <%= stylesheet_link_tag "yourfile" %> in the views, as normal.
      
      It will generate one .css for each .less
      in public/stylesheets.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    -- It knows about production mode --
    
          In development mode, it compiles the CSS whenever
          it is changed, so that you can edit your .less and
          the site to see how it looks. It is very fabolous,
          and the plugin has won many prizes for this.
          
          In other modes such as production and test,
          it compiles changed CSS files when the application boots.

                      Are you using Less for all your stylesheets? Perhaps
                      you should add `public/stylesheets/*.css` to your
                      .gitignore.
